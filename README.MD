Botnet Simulator
Overview

The Botnet Simulator is a web application that allows users to simulate the creation, expansion, and mitigation of a botnet. This platform provides a visual representation of how botnets operate, demonstrating how they can propagate across a network, launch attacks like DDoS, and how these threats can be mitigated through various strategies. The goal is to offer a tool for ethical hackers, security researchers, and educators to understand and explore botnet behavior in a controlled environment.
Features

    Botnet Visualization: Displays a dynamic map of bots within the network, showing their status and activity.
    Attack Simulation: Launches simulated attacks (e.g., DDoS, Spam) from compromised bots against specified targets.
    Mitigation Controls: Implements strategies to mitigate or neutralize active bots in the network.
    Interactive Frontend: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring the botnet and executing controls.
    Backend API: Powers the simulation logic and handles requests from the frontend.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    Node.js 14+
    npm (or yarn)

Setup Instructions
1. Backend Setup

    Navigate to the backend directory:

    bash

cd backend/

Install the required Python packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the backend server:

bash

    python run.py

    The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

    bash

cd frontend/

Install the required npm packages:

bash

npm install

Run the frontend development server:

bash

    npm start

    The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Connecting Frontend and Backend

Ensure that both the backend (Flask) and frontend (React) servers are running. The React frontend will make API calls to the Flask backend at http://localhost:5000. If necessary, you can configure a proxy in the React app's package.json to route requests correctly.
Initializing the Database

The database will be automatically created when the backend server is started. It will store information about bots, attacks, and their statuses. You can interact with the API endpoints to create bots, start attacks, and apply mitigation strategies.
API Endpoints
Bots

    GET /bots: Retrieve the list of all bots in the network.
    POST /create_bot: Create a new bot in the network.
    POST /mitigate_bot: Mitigate a specific bot by ID.

Attacks

    POST /start_attack: Start an attack from a specific bot against a target.

Future Enhancements

    Real-time Traffic Analysis: Visualize the traffic generated by bots in real-time.
    Advanced Attack Types: Implement additional types of attacks, such as ransomware or phishing simulations.
    Machine Learning for Mitigation: Introduce machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and mitigate bot activity.
    Detailed Post-Attack Reports: Generate comprehensive reports after each simulated attack, including visual graphs and statistics.
